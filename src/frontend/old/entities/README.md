## What is this folder for?
In this folder we will create and store classes for the entities we use throughout all the Front End.

The purpose of having those entities is to have a single interface to work with their data, for example, a protocol, which should have a definition and its data, along with their name, version, et cetera.

Whenever we have to work with data from the Back-end, or data that relates to our business model, we should use its class under this folder.
