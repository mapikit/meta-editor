## What is this folder for?
In this folder we store all the UI views for the meta-editor.

A view is simply a major section of the meta-editor, akin to a window in a OS graphical environment. Some examples of views in meta editor are the hub, the projects view, the plugins view and so on.

Views should be made of other smaller components, intuitively called components, which belong in another folder.
